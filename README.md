- Simple application which writes and reads accounting ledger entries to a postgres database

Database

- Postgres database with a single Schema and single Entries table
- For development we'll be blowing up the database every time, and creating the schema (seeding soon TM)
- Later we'll introduce a migration proess for my self-learning

Secrets

- Secrets will be read from environment variables

Making the environments ready with data

- We'll be using [mage](https://magefile.org/) to preload a development appvault with secrets
